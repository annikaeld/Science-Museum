            <h2>Support</h2>
            <p>
                There are various ways you can support the museum.
                Donations are very welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and accessible to the whole
                community.

                You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum's collections.
                If you have some item or collection that you think others would enjoy, please let us know by contacting
                our Collections Department and they will be able to assist you.</p>

            <h2>Volunteer</h2>
            <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready for
                visitors to come and enjoy.

                Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to
                staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas
                for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.

                You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you'd like to find out
                more about how you can get involved.
            </p>

            <h2>Internships</h2>
            <p>Are you interested in working in a museum?

                Well you could be just the right person to enjoy an internship at the museum.
                You'll be learning from a number of different academics and people who are passionate about science and
                sharing it with the wider community.</p>
